# Python Challenges

This lab contains my solutions to the first seven Python Challenge exercises. First of all, the lab taught me how to install and run jupyter notebooks, since I solved the exercises in jupyter. Secondly, this exercise was a great introduction to various features in Python, such as http requests, regular expressions, manipulating zip files, and learning the language in general.
